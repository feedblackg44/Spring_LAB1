                I came here in search of really useful subjects
                I’ll need in the future, and our first lectures
                showed that I’m in the right place. I’m into the concept
                implemented by the Spring Framework and the teacher's approach,
                who explains exactly what problems this framework
                solves with examples of SOLID and OOP compatibility.

                I believe that this subject will develop
                my practical skills of working in a team.
                I have a little experience of working in a team,
                so I understand the aspects of teamwork. Also,
                I hope to implement my skills of working with
                web pages from the frontend and backend side,
                which I acquired in the second year of studies at KPI.

                I am not one of those who will happily accept time challenges,
                because my approach is "do the best".
                My task is to learn and understand what I’ll be doing in order
                to understand how each element of my work works.
                It takes a lot of time, but it gives you confidence and,
                in my opinion, is a pretty interesting way to pass the time.
