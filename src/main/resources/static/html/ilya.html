                If you want to know who am I, then I can say only that I am very lazy guy, who are lazy enough
                to not search function or method in google, but instead I will write it by myself.
                I will not say something like "I'm excited about our future work during this course" or
                "I will overcome all difficulties on our path". I know C# basics, OOP and some design patterns,
                so when I chose Spring framework I thought that I can handle it.

                Just like I said before, I can write something using C#. But my main programming language is Python,
                which I have studied just because I wanted to. I wrote my first project using this language
                in spring 2021, it was telegram bot that is a useful and comfortable schedule for our group.
                I continued development and even invited my friend to dev team. Now we are writing version 2.0 of
                this bot, which will turn it from a little Python program into a grown-up project written using Python,
                PostgreSQL, Node.js and React.js.

                I have tried a couple of programming languages besides of Python. Backend using PHP, Frontend using JS,
                HTML and CSS, little projects using .NET Framework, and now the time has come to try that only thing
                that waited for me for a couple of years - Java. Years ago i have met this programming language
                for the first time while searching for mods for minecraft. I changed something using Google and
                StackOverflow to help two conflicted mods to work together. And now i hope that my Java experience
                after this course would give me at least a new variant, new way to grow like a programmer.
